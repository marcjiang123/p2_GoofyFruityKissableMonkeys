## Description:
Our website will compare the prices of avocados to the prices of stocks. It will be like a higher or lower game for the user to guess. One tab will have a “higher or lower” game with a random stock, and another tab will allow the user to pick a stock and compare the two prices with graphs. The last tab will be a leaderboard of accounts with the highest win percentage.

Each user will have to create their own account to use the website. The account will track their win/loss record and the most recent stock lookups.
