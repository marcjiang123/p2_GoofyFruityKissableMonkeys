## Description:
Our website will compare the prices of avocados to the prices of stocks. It will be like a higher or lower game for the user to guess. One tab will have a “higher or lower” game with a random stock for each guess. On another tab, you can pick any stock (using API) and compare it to the price of avocados. The last tab will be a leaderboard of accounts with the highest high score.

Each user will have to create their own account to use the website. The account will track their high score
